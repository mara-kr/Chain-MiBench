This library provides a uniform interface to different I/O backends

The I/O backends supported are:
 * libmspconsole (poorly named): hardware UART module on MSP430
 * libmspsoftuart (aka. msp430-softuart): software UART using GPIO+Timer on MSP430
 * libedb: proxy output via the connection to EDB (Energy-interference-free Debugger)

With the help of this library, the backend can be switched with a
switch variable in the build config without any change to the code.
